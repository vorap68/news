Our Inspire the Dream 850 lifestyle running shoe celebrates the impact and achievements of African American culture. First introduced in 1996 as part of the New Balance Elite Series, it's designed with ABZORB technology and a ROLLBAR medial post for the same support and stability as the original. Up top, the premium upper features a design with pops of red and gold detailing to proudly celebrate black history.
